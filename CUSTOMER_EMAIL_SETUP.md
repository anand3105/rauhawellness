## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Admin Emails (anandjnu007@gmail.com):

**Check:**
1. Spam/Junk folder
2. Gmail filters or blocks
3. Terminal for error messages
4. That EMAIL_PASS is correct in .env.local

### Not Receiving Customer Emails:

**Check:**
1. Use a different email provider to test (not Gmail if having issues)
2. Check spam folder
3. Terminal for "Failed to send customer confirmation" errors
4. Verify Hostinger SMTP credentials are correct

### See Error in Terminal:

**Common errors and solutions:**

**Error: "Invalid login"**
```bash
Solution: Check EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS in .env.local
Verify: info@rauhawellness.com and Shameem@321
```

**Error: "Connection timeout"**
```bash
Solution: Try alternative port in .env.local
Change: EMAIL_PORT=587 and EMAIL_SECURE=false
```

**Error: "Failed to send customer confirmation"**
```bash
Solution: Check customer's email address is valid
Check: Terminal logs for specific error message
```

### Test SMTP Connection:

```bash
# Use the test script
node scripts/test-api.js
