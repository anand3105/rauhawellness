## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Error: "Invalid login"

**Solution:**
1. Verify your password is correct
2. Check that `info@rauhawellness.com` exists in Hostinger
3. Try resetting the password in Hostinger control panel

### ‚ùå Error: "Connection timeout"

**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify Hostinger SMTP settings are correct
3. Try using port 587 instead:
   ```env
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_SECURE=false
   ```

### ‚ùå Error: "Self-signed certificate"

**Solution:**
Add this to your `.env.local`:
```env
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
```
**Note:** Only use this for development, not production!

### üìß Emails not arriving

**Check:**
1. Spam folder in anandjnu007@gmail.com
2. Terminal for "‚úÖ Email sent successfully" message
3. Email quota in Hostinger (some plans have limits)
4. That `ADMIN_EMAIL` is correctly set

### üîç Check SMTP Connection

You can test SMTP directly:

```bash
node scripts/test-api.js
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ "Email sent successfully"
- ‚ùå Any error messages

---

## Alternative Ports

If port 465 doesn't work, try these alternatives:

### Option 1: Port 587 with STARTTLS
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
```

### Option 2: Port 25 (Less secure)
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
EMAIL_PORT=25
EMAIL_SECURE=false
```

## Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Use a strong, unique password for your email
- Keep `.env.local` in `.gitignore`
- Never share your email password
- Enable 2FA on your Hostinger account

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Commit `.env.local` to version control
- Share your password in screenshots
- Use the same password for multiple services
- Store passwords in plain text elsewhere

---

## Email Limits

Hostinger email accounts typically have:
- **Sending limit:** 100-300 emails per hour (depending on plan)
- **Storage:** 1-10 GB (depending on plan)

For high-volume sending, consider:
- Upgrading Hostinger plan
- Using a dedicated email service (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- Implementing email queuing

---

## How It Works

1. **Customer submits quiz or waitlist**
2. **Data saved to JSON file** (data/quiz-responses.json or data/waitlist.json)
3. **Email notification sent FROM** info@rauhawellness.com
4. **Email notification sent TO** anandjnu007@gmail.com
5. **You receive beautiful HTML email** with customer details

---

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):

1. **Add environment variables** in hosting platform:
   - ADMIN_EMAIL
   - EMAIL_HOST
   - EMAIL_PORT
   - EMAIL_SECURE
   - EMAIL_USER
   - EMAIL_PASS

2. **Migrate from file storage to database**
