## ðŸ“§ Email Notifications

Every quiz submission and waitlist sign-up triggers an instant email notification to **anandjnu007@gmail.com**.

### Setup Email Notifications

See **EMAIL_SETUP.md** for detailed setup instructions.

**Quick setup:**
1. Get Gmail App Password
2. Update `.env.local` with your credentials
3. Restart your dev server

**Email Templates:**
- Beautiful HTML design with Rauha branding
- All customer details included
- Mobile-responsive
- Plain text fallback

---

## Data Storage

### Location
All data is stored in: `/data/`
- `quiz-responses.json` - Quiz submissions
- `waitlist.json` - Waitlist entries

### Format
Data is stored in pretty-printed JSON format for easy reading and manual editing if needed.

### Backup
**Important:** Make regular backups of the `/data/` directory to prevent data loss.

---

## Future Migration Options

This file-based system can be easily migrated to any database:

### Option 1: PostgreSQL / MySQL
Replace file operations with database queries in the API routes.

### Option 2: MongoDB
Replace JSON files with MongoDB collections.

### Option 3: Prisma ORM
Add Prisma to the project and update API routes to use Prisma client.

### Option 4: Cloud Services (Supabase, Firebase, etc.)
Re-implement the original Supabase code or use Firebase SDK.

## Security Notes

1. **Data Directory** - The `/data/` folder is gitignored to protect user data
2. **Email Validation** - Basic validation is performed on the backend
3. **Error Handling** - All errors are logged but not exposed to users
4. **CORS** - Next.js API routes are same-origin by default

---

## Development

To view stored data:
```bash
# View quiz responses
cat data/quiz-responses.json

# View waitlist
cat data/waitlist.json
```

To reset data:
```bash
# Delete all data
rm -rf data/
```

---

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), you'll need to:

1. **Use a database** - File-based storage doesn't work on serverless platforms
2. **Choose Option 1, 2, or 3 above** for production
3. **Update API routes** accordingly

For quick deployment, consider:
- **Vercel** with Vercel Postgres
- **Railway** with PostgreSQL
- **PlanetScale** for MySQL
- **MongoDB Atlas** for MongoDB
