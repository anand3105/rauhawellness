# Email Deliverability Guide - Preventing Spam Issues

## Why Your Emails Go to Spam

Your emails from `info@rauhawellness.com` may be going to spam for these reasons:

### 1. **Missing Domain Authentication (MOST IMPORTANT)**
Without proper DNS records, email providers can't verify your emails are legitimate.

### 2. **New Domain/Low Sender Reputation**
- rauhawellness.com is a new domain
- No email sending history
- Email providers are cautious with new senders

### 3. **Email Content Issues**
- Too promotional
- Missing plain text version
- Too many links
- Spam trigger words

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE FIXES TO IMPLEMENT

### 1. Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Records (CRITICAL)

Contact your **Hostinger support** or access your DNS settings and add these records:

#### **SPF Record** (Sender Policy Framework)
```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or rauhawellness.com)
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.hostinger.com ~all
```

#### **DKIM Record** (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
You need to generate DKIM keys in Hostinger:
1. Go to Hostinger Email ‚Üí Settings
2. Look for "DKIM Settings" or "Email Authentication"
3. Generate DKIM key
4. Add the provided TXT record to your DNS

#### **DMARC Record** (Domain-based Message Authentication)
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:info@rauhawellness.com; pct=100; adkim=s; aspf=s
```

**How to Add DNS Records in Hostinger:**
1. Log in to Hostinger
